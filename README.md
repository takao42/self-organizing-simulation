# self-organizing-simulation

<p>This is a self organization algorithm test using Kohonen's self-organizing map theory.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>1. Make a random cell matrix</p>
<p>2. Make a random color</p>
<p>3. Find the cell with the nearest color to the random color in the matrix<p>
<p>4. Mix the random color with the color of the cell and its neighboring cells a little bit</p>
<p>5. What a magic! Cells start organizing colors by themselves with this simple algorithm.</p>
